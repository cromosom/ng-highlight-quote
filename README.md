# Highlight Quote

This simple angular 4 directive should highlight quotes in a text.

To ensure stable execution I added a dockerfile and special npm commands to run the app in docker.

## Setup

To run it locally angular/cli should be installed globally. Then run:

`npm install`

To run it in a docker environment:

`npm install`

`npm run setup`

## Run

Local:

`ng serve`

In docker:

`npm run serve`

You can access the app in a browser on localhost:4200.

## Test

Local:

`ng test`

In docker:

`npm run test`

You can access the tests in a browser on localhost:9876.
